# hello-world

Hi everyone.

I'm currently trying to nail ten finger typing and java at the same time.-2018
Hey guys so I nailed 10 finger typing(kind of) and I hate java now(lol). I've picked up and dropped a few things along the way(robotics, arduino, java).
I'm now focusing more on solving Competitive problems and C++ Data Structures. Working on a game using Unity C# and planning to pick up Blockchain Programming by the end of this year.
See ya next October. See ya!
