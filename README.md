# hello-world

Hi everyone!  
  
I'm currently trying to nail ten finger typing and java at the same time.    - Oct 2018  
  
  
Hey guys so I nailed 10 finger typing(kind of) and I hate java now(lol).  
I've picked up and dropped a few things along the way(robotics, arduino, java).  
I'm now focusing more on solving Competitive problems and C++ Data Structures,  
working on a game using Unity C# and planning to pick up Blockchain Programming by the end of this year.  
See ya next October. Ciao!                                                 -Oct 2018
